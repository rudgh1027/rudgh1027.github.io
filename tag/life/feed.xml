      <content type="html" xml:base="/Take_a_trip">&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Few years ago, I thought trip is waste of time and money. Maybe it was a repulsion of spending lots of money. Now, When I think about it, I should have worked hard to earn budget for a trip.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, going to other country always gives me special things. This thought came to my mind when I went to Nepal for volumteer. We met local people, held a worship, donated, and prey for them. They had a problem with India, because Goverment of India force Nepalee to have one and only one religion, Hindu. Nevertheless, they welcomed us and serve local foods. They filled in my heart more than what we gave to them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
