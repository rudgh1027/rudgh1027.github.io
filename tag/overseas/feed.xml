      <content type="html" xml:base="/Taking_a_trip">&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Few years ago, I thought trip is waste of time and money. Maybe it was a repulsion of spending lots of money. Now, When I think about it, I should have worked hard to earn budget for a trip and gave my times to go trip for me.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-nepal--2016-jan-&quot;&gt;1. NEPAL ( 2016. Jan )&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to other country always gives me special things. This thought came to my mind when I went to Nepal for volumteer. We met local people, held a worship, donated, and prayed for them. They had a problem with India, because Goverment of India force Nepalese to have one and only one religion, Hindu. Nevertheless, they welcomed us and serve local foods. They filled in my heart more than what we gave to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After volunteering activity, He trekked the Himalayas. It was tough experience I haven’t faced. But it made us a team. Every single member were just human with weak body compared to nature. Actually, some of our members couldn’t see beautiful scene from top of the Poon Hill(3210 M). They stayed just an hour away from the hill. But they were together within our heart.&lt;/p&gt;

It was 3rd times to visit Osaka and Universal Studio Japan. Amusement part of there is always awesome and I like Japanese food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-netherlands--2018-dec-&quot;&gt;3. Netherlands ( 2018. Dec )&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Netherlands.jpg&quot; /&gt;
It was wet and chilly mid night. Nothing can do anything except finding cafe to stay. I was supposed to depart toward Portugal early in the morning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-portugal--2018-dec-&quot;&gt;4. Portugal ( 2018. Dec )&lt;/h3&gt;
